## Improving Transformers World Model - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of the new SOTA for model based RL, from the paper [Improving Transformer World Models for Data-Efficient RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01591), in Pytorch.

They significantly outperformed DreamerV3 with a transformer world model and a less complicated setup, on Craftax (simplified Minecraft environment).
